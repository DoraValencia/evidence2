Especially in this class I was really scared because I don't like programming and in my business programming class I did really bad.
Impressively with this class I feel super happy because the teacher implemented a new collaborative learning strategy.
It was dynamic and interactive, I took a lot of tools with me so that in the future I can implement them in my business or at least have a knowledge of these tools.
With this class I felt that the programming was easy and dynamic, I felt very comfortable, thank you very much teacher.
